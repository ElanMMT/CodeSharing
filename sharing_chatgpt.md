# Q: retrieve_resource
I have some resource stored in std::vector<std::shared_ptr<MyResource>> resource;
then I have a function to retrieve the resource in some condition, for example `retrieve_resource(int id)`, which matches the id with the stored MyResource::id.
how to design the return type of retrieve_resource?

## ChatGPT:
When designing the return type of `retrieve_resource(int id)`, you have several considerations:

1. **What to return if the resource is found?**
2. **What to return if the resource is not found?**
3. **How to handle ownership and lifetime of the resource?**

Given that your resources are stored in a `std::vector<std::shared_ptr<MyResource>>`, it's clear that multiple parts of your code can own and manage the same resource. This is the purpose of `std::shared_ptr`.

Here are some potential designs for the return type of `retrieve_resource`:

1. **Return `std::shared_ptr<MyResource>` directly**:
   - If found: Return the `std::shared_ptr<MyResource>`.
   - If not found: Return a `nullptr` (null shared pointer).
   - This approach allows the caller to share ownership of the resource.

     ```cpp
     std::shared_ptr<MyResource> retrieve_resource(int id) {
         for (const auto& res : resource) {
             if (res->id == id) {
                 return res;
             }
         }
         return nullptr; // or std::shared_ptr<MyResource>() which is equivalent
     }
     ```

2. **Return `std::optional<std::shared_ptr<MyResource>>`**:
   - If found: Return the `std::shared_ptr<MyResource>`.
   - If not found: Return an empty `std::optional`.
   - This approach makes it explicit that the resource might not be found.

     ```cpp
     #include <optional>

     std::optional<std::shared_ptr<MyResource>> retrieve_resource(int id) {
         for (const auto& res : resource) {
             if (res->id == id) {
                 return res;
             }
         }
         return std::nullopt;
     }
     ```

3. **Return `MyResource*`**:
   - If found: Return the raw pointer to the resource.
   - If not found: Return `nullptr`.
   - This approach does not share ownership but gives access to the resource. The caller must be careful not to store and use this pointer beyond the lifetime of the original `std::shared_ptr`.

     ```cpp
     MyResource* retrieve_resource(int id) {
         for (const auto& res : resource) {
             if (res->id == id) {
                 return res.get();
             }
         }
         return nullptr;
     }
     ```

Which approach you choose depends on your specific requirements. If you want the caller to share ownership, go with the first or second approach. If you just want to provide access without sharing ownership, go with the third approach. However, always be cautious with raw pointers to ensure you don't run into issues with dangling pointers or memory leaks.
